## What is Fine

&emsp;&emsp;Fine is a tool to help you generate document sites from individual documents without a server required on your part. It is fast, safe and easy to use, plus you don’t have to worry about neither style nor implementation at all.

&emsp;&emsp;You can even use Fine to start your own blog, as it provides customized domains to each site it generates.

&emsp;&emsp;And of course, as a rule of thumb, Fine is always free.
